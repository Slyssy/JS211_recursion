# JS211_recursion

> Write a recursive JavaScript program to find the greatest common divisor (gcd)
> of two positive numbers.

<em>Example: findGCD(25, 20) // => 5 findGCD(50, 20) // => 10</em>

> Write a recursive JavaScript program to compute the exponent of any number
> given.

<em>Example: If you were given the number 64: 8 \*\* 2 = 8 x 8 = 64. Here 8 is the base and 2 is the exponent.</em>

>

> Write a recursive JavaScript program to compute the sum of an array of integers.

<em>Example : const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] sumArr(array1) // => Expected
Output : 21</em>
